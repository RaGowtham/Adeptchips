To create library file in dynamically

gcc -shared -fPIC <files> -o <renaming with prefix lib and postfix is .so>

so - stands for shared objects
fPIC - stands for file position indepented file
shared - for shared object file means dynamic linking

To tell the OS it's going to dynamically linkable

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<location of shared file>"


To compile


gcc -L < Path of libraries > < c file > -l<library name without prefix and postfix>
